# particle_life_flutter
Flutter implementation of [Clusters](http://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/)

Initial code based on [quarfzs's Flutter project](https://github.com/quarfzs/particle-life)

# Releases
- [Web App](https://particle-life-flutter.vercel.app)

# Status
- [x] Migrating code to null safety
- [ ] Refactoring & better types

# Other thoughts
- I'm considering making another [Flame](https://pub.dev/packages/flame) "particle microworld".  Will probably not be a port of Clusters
